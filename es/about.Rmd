## About this study

The Needs Assessment for Older People in Disasters and Humanitarian Crises is a methodology developed by HelpAge to provide the best possible description of the situation and priority needs of older people in emergencies, considering that access to data and time for data collection and analysis for this population group is limited. 

For the purposes of this evaluation, other areas of protection and rights were addressed, and the tools were adapted to larger virtual data collection and analysis processes.
