## Introduction
There is little information on the situation of older persons on the move in the Latin American region. This regional evaluation is the first one to make a comprehensive analysis on the intersectionality between ageing and human mobility. The current situation of the COVID-19 pandemic is also analysed, including the worsening access to rights and services and the impact in their lives.  

The assessment focuses in __five countries in the region: El Salvador, Honduras, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru__. El Salvador and Honduras mainly characterised by internal displacement flows resulting from gang or mara violence, returnees and the socio-economic difficulties caused by the pandemic. While Colombia, Ecuador and Peru are mainly characterized by mixed movements (refugees and migrants) as a result of the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, which has led to the exodus of millions of people. 

ADD a sentence on the differences between situations

<aside>
A total of 725 older persons were consulted via telephone, as well as caretakers, service providers and key actors with in-depth and semi-structured interviews and online surveys. 


</aside>

With this report, UNHCR and HelpAge aim to cast light on the challenges and risks faced by older persons on the move so that actions take place to ensure that they are protected and no longer left behind.

## Call to Action

Older persons in forced displacement have long encountered insufficient protection and neglect. Their __full inclusion__ in national responses to the pandemic is key in order to safeguard their dignity and rights. Besides increased humanitarian support, older displaced people need greater livelihoods opportunities, to become financially independent.

The international community is called upon to include older persons on the move as a priority group in all their agendas, adapting and financing the institutional structure that responds to their needs. This should be translated into humanitarian responses and programmes that include older persons on the move as direct beneficiaries, guaranteeing their dignity, autonomy, independence and participation, avoiding interventions that expose them to situations of dependency, abuse and discrimination. 


Globally, States are called upon to push forward the project to draft and adopt a United Nations International Convention on the Protection of Older Persons, led by the  [Open-Ended Working Group on Ageing](https://social.un.org/ageing-working-group/).  This global effort has been underway since 2011 within the United Nations framework to identify gaps in the protection of older persons in the international human rights system. Regionally, it is important that States in the Americas  adhere to and implement the  [Inter-American Convention on Protecting the Human Rights of Older Persons](http://www.oas.org/en/sla/dil/inter_american_treaties_a-70_human_rights_older_persons.asp), as the legal framework in force for all American States, adapting their domestic laws in the light of this instrument and other relevant International and Regional Human Rights Law protection frameworks. To this end, two more adhesions are needed to complete the minimum number of States required to activate the monitoring mechanism foreseen to promote effective compliance.  To date, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Perú and Uruguay have adhered to the Convention.




## What are the protection risks and challenges faced by older persons on the move in the Americas?

Include GIF with main findings to open section.










### Living for months without documents and information 

In all countries there are older people who are unable to complete their regularization procedures and get their documents, either because they are alone (11% of all people live alone) or because of distance or lack of accessibility (67% of the older population say that they have difficulties in accessing and travelling on public transport).

<aside>
In the Andean region, a third of respondents indicated that there is a lack of information regarding the regularization procedures. In contrast, most of the older people interviewed from Honduras and El Salvador hold identity documents from their own country, which enables them to access different rights and services.
</aside>


```{r, layout="l-screen"}
include_graphics("images/SPA_WIDE_MACRO 5.png")
```

Older persons on the move in the Andean region are the most affected by lack of documentation: 24% of all surveyed did not have any documentation. This figure worsens among persons with disabilities, which increases vulnerability. Here also a gender difference is found: 27% of women having no documentation at all, compared to 19% of men. In this region, even though the percentage of those in need of international protection is high, the percentage of those with refugee status is low, reaching only 9% among respondent. Many Venezuelans, for several reasons, opt for other types of regularization in host countries.

### Many have limited access to health care 


<p class=“tweetable”>
Older people consulted have limited access to health care.
</p>

 42% of respondents are not receiving treatment for different health conditions either due to missed medical appointments, lack of documentation, lack of money to pay for medicine or fear of approaching health centres due to the risk of contagion.  Difficulties in getting around or distance from health centres are only rarely given as reasons.

<aside>
On average, around 30% of older people consulted did not use health services even when they were needing them before the pandemic.  
</aside>

More than a fifth of those who used health services have had to pay, which, given the severe financial condition that most older people in situations of human mobility are subject to, severely limits their ability to access the services they need.



### Facing job losses and lack of income 

Older refugees have been deprived of their financial autonomy as many have lost their jobs and source of income and been left dependent on the often inexistant humanitarian aid. In Honduras and El Salvador, a third of those surveyed reported that they had lost their job. In the countries of the Andean region, half of those interviewed have lost their jobs.

<p class=“tweetable”>
Some 64% of older persons surveyed had no monthly income before the pandemic, and of those who did have an income, 62% felt it had not been enough to meet their basic needs.
</p>

Despite their increased vulnerability, __older persons on the move have often become the main bread-winners for the household__ as they continue to have family members under their care, including children and adolescents (60%), adults (38%), people over 60 years old (20%) and people with disabilities (5%)

```


### A quarter of older people surveyed are not eating 3 meals a day. 

Access to food for older people on the move has worsened in all countries assessed. Already prior to the pandemic, one in four were having to skip meals. With the advent of COVID-19, 41 per cent had to further reduce their food intake. 
Even for those who eat sufficient number of meals per day, it does not imply that they enjoy an adequate nutritional balance, as in many cases food consumption is mainly composed of carbohydrates, especially in rural areas of Honduras and El Salvador, with little protein or no ingredients suitable for older people's diets.  

<p class=“tweetable”>
Access to food is provided mainly through the support of family members and their own income, or to a greater extent through the support of neighbours or friends.
</p>

### Poor housing impacts the lives of older people 

<aside>
During the pandemic, housing conditions worsened for one fifth of those interviewed, as they were unable to afford rent. Five per cent of the survey’s respondents had been evicted during the pandemic.
</aside>

On average, 61% of the older people surveyed live in rented accommodation and only 20% have their own flat or house. Women seem to have less housing security than men. Some 66% of women live in rented accommodation, almost 10 points higher than men, at 57%, and only 17% live in their own home compared to 24% of men. 

__In Honduras and El Salvador, 44% of people live in a flat or house of their own, a marked contrast to the countries in the Andean region, where only 9% of people live in a flat or house of their own__. In Honduras and El Salvador, the average number of people living in rented accommodation (32%) is much lower than in the Andean countries (79%), where mixed movements reach an average of 85%.  

More than a third of the population lives in a single room and half of the population shares a room with one or two other people ; overcrowding was reported to a lesser extent, with 13% the of respondents reporting that three or more people sharing a room . Overcrowding is also a matter of concern for the internally displaced population in Honduras, which reaches a third of the population, and for refugees and asylum-seekers in Colombia, which exceeds half of the population. These figures are similar those relating to refugees or asylum-seekers in Peru.

 



### Older people on the move have limited access to humanitarian aid
<aside>
Less than half of the older people surveyed reported receiving humanitarian aid (36% in northern Central America and 49% in the Andean region). 
</aside>

In all countries, aid mainly involves food and toiletries, with 48% in Honduras and El Salvador and 52% in the Andean countries. In second place, subsidies, economic support or cash transfers stand out, with 35% in Honduras and El Salvador and 45% in the Andean region.

```{r, layout="l-screen"}

```

__While in the Andean region, half of respondents reported receiving humanitarian aid, in Honduras and El Salvador, this was the case of only a third of respondents. __ 

## Older persons need to be empowered

Around 84% of older persons have not attended talks or took part in training and awareness-raising activities concerning their rights. 

<aside>
More than 2/3 had no activities to share or to socialize with others. Women presented a higher percentage of non-participation than men.
</aside>



### Using the right communication channel

More than 85% of older persons have access to mobile phones, 70% to a television and only 35% to a radio. Though only 10% have access to landline phones, laptops, entertainment devices, tablets and desktop computers. In general, older people's mobile phones are not smartphones, and several use their relatives' mobile phones to communicate and connect to the Internet. One of their main uses for mobile phones is to connect with family members via WhatsApp.   

Average Internet access is slightly above one third of the respondents, except for the mixed movements in Colombia and Ecuador, where it exceeds half of the population.




### Discriminated by their age. 
 

```{r, layout="l-screen"}
include_graphics("images/SPA_WIDE_MACRO 2.png")
```

Half of the older people on the move interviewed for the report described having experienced discrimination while a worrying number described incidents of abuse. 
38% of the respondents reported being  abused in the countries where they reside and before the pandemic   with a marked difference between those with disabilities (48%) and those without (29%). During the pandemic, averages of abuse do not seem to be subject to significant fluctuations; however, only a quarter of people attend medical facilities following abuse and 23% report abuse, leaving a substantial percentage of people unprotected in this respect. 

In Honduras and El Salvador, the percentage of elder abuse is 63%, with a significant difference between persons with disabilities (87%) compared to those without disabilities (40%). The gender difference is 11 points, with 65% for men compared to 57% for women. In the Andean region, mistreatment is lower, affecting a quarter of the population (26%), and there is a gender difference of 34% for women compared to 20% for men.

The most commonly occurring type of abuse against older persons with disabilities in the countries of the Andean region is eviction (8%), affecting more women than men in this situation, by three percentage points.  

Among the perpetrators of abuse, 11% were family members; 7% were government officials, including the security forces; 7% were friends or neighbours; and 74% were other people, for example, armed actors, gangs, people on the street, on public transport, or the owners of the homes which they rented or where they lived.

## COVID-19 has affected the livelihoods, mental health and physical conditions of older people across Latin America.

 

```{r, layout="l-screen"}
include_graphics("images/SPA_WIDE_MACRO 1.png")
```

The COVID-19 pandemic has gravely worsened the wellbeing of older people on the move across Latin America, by further limiting their access to rights and services. The pandemic has exacerbating pre-existing threats to the physical and mental health, nutrition, financial autonomy and legal status of older refugees and others on the move. 


Half of those interviewed described having experienced discrimination while a worrying number described incidents of abuse. 
There was evidence of an increase in the limitations of access to health services to treat symptoms or illness different to those associated with the virus during the pandemic. This limitation is even greater in people with disabilities. In addition, 6 per cent of those infected with COVID-19 reported not receiving adequate medical care. 


The psychological effects of the pandemic are one the biggest identified problems, relating to depression, anxiety, and the constant fear of contagion or death. The illness or emotional disorders have intensified, especially in older people who are victims of internal displacement and deportations.  

<p class=“tweetable”>
Emotional illnesses and disorders have been intensified by the pandemic. 
</p>


__Isolation is one of the most important effects of COVID-+19__, as people cannot meet with friends and family as they normally would, and their recreation is also reduced. The pandemic has led to a decrease in the daily contact of older persons on the move with their families, from 39% to 26%, which has an impact on feelings of isolation and loneliness. Isolation aggravates physical and mental health conditions.  

Overall, limitation in accessing health services to treat symptoms or illnesses other than those associated with the virus is increasing, reaching 43% in Honduras and El Salvador and 44% in the Andean region. The limitation is even greater for persons with disabilities, involving half of the respondent.  

## Conclusions 

The study unveils a series of specific vulnerability for older persons on the move that needs to be accounted for in the design of the humanitarian response:

* __Irregularity or lack of access to asylum facilities can lead to a series of risks and difficulties in the enjoyment of rights by older persons on the move__. This was mainstreamed in the results that were analysed in terms of access to health, housing, work and security, among other rights. The main difficulties for obtaining documentation are, on the one hand, the high degree of misinformation on administrative procedures required to remain in the countries legally and, on the other, the absence of a priority and adapted approach to provide documentation by the respective authorities for this specific group.  

* Older persons have a number of health problems that tend to receive little attention. After hypertension, which is more expected, __mental health__ is the second most prevalent condition and is linked to human mobility in all countries. 

* The vast majority of the older persons on the move surveyed live in a situation of great economic vulnerability, since __very few or no pensions are received__, and access to work is limited by the conditions of the labour markets, by the lack of documentation and by discrimination mainly due to age and mobility. All this leads to informality in situations of precariousness and labour exploitation, with long working hours and low incomes, as well as degrading and dangerous situations. Precarious conditions are worsened in rural areas, especially for groups of people who may face forced displacement. 

* There is a sector of the older population that is not being adequately nourished, with __more than a quarter of respondents not eating three meals a day, compounded by a decrease in meal consumption as a result of the pandemic__. Older people's diets are not nutritionally balanced, and guidance and resources on how to improve diets, control overweight, and prevent chronic diseases are not adequately provided. 

* The older population on the move is subject to poor security in terms of the right to housing. There are cases of overcrowding in Honduras, Colombia, and Peru. __Eviction is another serious risk for older persons__ and is a form of mistreatment of this population group as well as their families. 

* __Psychological abuse__ is linked to insecurity and violence: Older persons on the move are more vulnerable than the rest of the population. Women suffer higher percentages of psychological abuse in several cases, and it is necessary to consider gender differences in terms of the forms of mistreatment. People in transit are at higher risk of abuse due to the added vulnerability that crossing irregular border crossings sometimes entails.
