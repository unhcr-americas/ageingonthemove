## Introduction
There is little information on the situation of older persons on the move in the Latin American region. This regional evaluation is the first one to make a comprehensive analysis on the intersectionality between ageing and human mobility. The current situation of the COVID-19 pandemic is also analysed, including the worsening access to rights and services and the impact in their lives.  

The assessment focuses in five countries in the region, with El Salvador and Honduras mainly characterised by internal displacement flows resulting from gang or mara violence, returnees and the socio-economic difficulties caused by the pandemic. While Colombia, Ecuador and Peru mainly characterized by  mixed movements (refugees and migrants) as a result of the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, which has led to the exodus of millions of people.


<aside>
A total of 725 older persons were consulted via telephone, as well as caretakers, service providers, and key actors with semi-structured interviews 62 surveys to service providers and 78 in-depth interviews with older people,. 
</aside>

UNHCR and HelpAge aim to cast light on the challenges and risks faced by older persons on the move so that actions take place to ensure that they are protected and no longer left behind.




## Recommendations

The International Humanitarian System, Agencies and Donors are called upon to include older persons in situations of human mobility as a priority and vulnerable group in all their agendas, adapting and financing the institutional structure that responds to their needs. This should be translated into humanitarian responses and programmes that include older persons in human mobility as direct beneficiaries, guaranteeing their dignity, autonomy, independence and participation, avoiding interventions that expose them to situations of dependency, abuse and discrimination. Humanitarian aid should include physical and mental health care, and housing or shelter support, given the general impacts and risks those evictions can generate. Support for work or entrepreneurship should also be considered.

Globally, States are called upon to push forward the project to draft and adopt a United Nations International Convention on the Protection of Older Persons, led by the [Open-Ended Working Group on Ageing](https://social.un.org/ageing-working-group/).  

Regionally, it is important for States to adhere to and implement the [Inter-American Convention on Protecting the Human Rights of Older Persons](http://www.oas.org/en/sla/dil/inter_american_treaties_a-70_human_rights_older_persons.asp), as the legal framework in force for all American States, adapting their domestic laws in the light of this instrument and other relevant International and Regional Human Rights Law protection frameworks. To this end, ten States must complete their accession to the IACPHROP to activate the monitoring mechanism foreseen to promote effective compliance.  

## What are the profiles and condition of older people on the move in the Americas?

Among the countries included in the assessment, in Honduras and El Salvador, human mobility is mainly characterised by internal displacement flows resulting from gang or mara violence, people deported mainly from the United States and Mexico, and the socio-economic difficulties caused by COVID-19. In the Andean region, mixed movements (refugees and migrants) are mainly observed as a result of the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, which has led to the exodus of millions of people. Their needs are closely tied to access to basic needs such as food and health services. 

The three main causes of human mobility identified in the countries of Honduras and El Salvador are access to work or income opportunities (47% overall), with a  significant gender difference of 53% for men and 39% for women, the causes of which affect principally deportees (70%).  The need for protection from threats, violence or persecution (28% overall), and is the main cause of mobility for 36% of IDPs. Supporting the family (25% overall), is the main third main cause reported by 47% of deportees. These three main causes affected, 81% of older person in human mobility and their family members. 

In the countries of the Andean region, the main cause of human mobility is access to food (76%), reaching 84% in the refugee and migrant population and with a gender difference of almost 10 points: 71% men vs 80% women. The second main cause is a lack of access to health (73%), with a 12 -point difference among persons with disabilities, whereby 80% lack access compared to 68% of those without disabilities. Here too, there is a marked difference between men (66%) and women (79%). The third cause is access to work or income opportunities (58%), with a difference of almost ten points between men (63%) and women (54%), and with a difference between persons with disabilities (52%) and those without (62%). 

In 89% of the cases, these reasons for human mobility affected not only the older person but also his or her family group, making family reunification a fourth cause.  

## What challenges are being faced by older persons on the move in the Americas?

Include GIF with main findings to open section.










###	Facing job losses and lack of income 

Older refugees have been deprived of their financial autonomy as many have lost their jobs and source of income and been left dependent on the often inexistant humanitarian aid. In Honduras and El Salvador, a third of those surveyed reported that they had lost their job. In the countries of the Andean region, 49% of those interviewed have lost their jobs.


```{r, layout="l-screen"}
include_graphics("images/SPA_WIDE_MACRO 3.png")
```

Around 64% of older people surveyed had no monthly income before the pandemic, and of those who did have an income, 62% felt it had not been enough to meet their basic needs.

Despite their increased vulnerability, older people on the move have often become the main bread-winners for the household as they continue to have family members under their care, including children and adolescents (60%), adults (38%), people over 60 years old (20%) and people with disabilities (5%)
 

### Many have gone from 3 meals to 1 a day 

Of the older people surveyed in the five countries, 74% had access to three meals a day before the pandemic, 19% had access to only two meals, 2% had access to only one meal, and 2% sometimes had no meals at all.  

Although the average number of meals per day is high, this does not imply that older people can enjoy an adequate nutritional balance for older people, as in many cases food consumption is mainly composed of carbohydrates, especially in rural areas of Honduras and El Salvador, with little protein or no ingredients suitable for older people's diets.  

Access to food is provided mainly through the support of family members and their own income, or to a greater extent through the support of neighbours or friends.

###	Most live with one or two roommates, if not more 

On average, 61% of the older people surveyed live in rented accommodation and only 20% have their own flat or house. Women seem to have less housing security than men. Some 66% of women live in rented accommodation, almost 10 points higher than men, at 57%, and only 17% live in their own home compared to 24% of men. 

In Honduras and El Salvador, 44% of people live in a flat or house of their own, a marked contrast to the countries of the Andean region, where only 9% of people live in a flat or house of their own. In Honduras and El Salvador, the average number of people living in rented accommodation (32%) is much lower than in the Andean countries (79%), where mixed movements reach an average of 85%.  

More than a third of the population lives in a single room (36%) and half of the population shares a room with one or two other people (51%); overcrowding was reported to a lesser extent, with three or more people sharing a room (13%). Overcrowding is a matter of concern for the internally displaced population in Honduras, which reaches a third of the population (34%), and for refugees or refugee status seekers in Colombia, which exceeds half of the population (57%), as well as for migrants in Colombia, which exceeds a fifth of the population (22%). These figures are similar those relating to refugees or refugee status seekers in Peru (20%).

 

###	Living for months without documents and information 



```{r, layout="l-screen"}
include_graphics("images/SPA_WIDE_MACRO 5.png")
```

Older refugees and migrants indicate that there is a lack of information regarding the regularization procedures in the countries of the Andean region (32%). While most of the older people, from the Honduras and El Salvador, interviewed hold identity documents from their own country, which enables them to access different rights and services.


Older persons in conditions of human mobility in the Andean region are the most affected by lack of documentation, where a 24% of all surveyed did not have any documentation. This figure worsens among people with disabilities, which represents a double vulnerability.

There is also a gender difference, with 27% of women having no documentation at all, compared to 19% of men. In this region, even though the percentage of those in need of international protection is high, the percentage of those with refugee status is low, reaching only 9% of the total sample. Many Venezuelans, for several reasons, opt for other types of regularisation in host countries.

Quote from report in page 83



In all countries there are older people who are unable to complete their regularisation procedures and get their documents, either because they are alone (11% of all people live alone) or because of distance or lack of accessibility (67% of the older population say that they have difficulties in accessing and travelling on public transport).


### How to be on the move with little access to support? 



```{r, layout="l-screen"}
include_graphics("images/SPA_WIDE_MACRO 4.png")
```

Thirty-six percent of older respondents from Honduras and El Salvador reported receiving humanitarian aid, compared to 49% of those from the Andean region.  Older internally displaced people (IDPs) in Honduras and El Salvador have received 54% assistance compared to 82% in the case of IDPs in Colombia.

In all countries, aid mainly involves food and toiletries, with 48% in Honduras and El Salvador and 52% in the Andean countries. In second place, subsidies, economic support or cash transfers stand out, with 35% in Honduras and El Salvador and 45% in the Andean region.

Most older persons own mobile phones (87%), followed by television (70%) and radio (35%). Only 10% have access to landline phones, laptops, entertainment devices, tablets and desktop computers. In general, older people's mobile phones are not smartphones, and several use their relatives' mobile phones to communicate and connect to the Internet. One of their main uses for mobile phones is to connect with family members via WhatsApp.   

Average Internet access is slightly above one third of the sample, except for the mixed movements in Colombia and Ecuador, where it exceeds half of the population (57%). Eighty-four percent of older persons have not attended talks or took part in training and awareness-raising activities concerning their rights. Only 7% have received training on rights as a person in situations of human mobility, 6% on their rights as older persons, and 7% on how to become productive through work or entrepreneurship.  

## What are the specific protection risks they are exposed to?

###  Many have limited access to care (Health, Care and Accessibility)
Include graph from report
Could be main issues reported graph from page 101

Most of the older people surveyed have limited access to health care, with 42% not receiving treatment for different health conditions either due to missed medical appointments, lack of documentation, lack of money to pay for medicine or fear of approaching health centres due to the risk of contagion. The assessment also revealed that six percent of those who were infected with COVID-19 did not receive adequate treatment.

On average, 29% of older people surveyed did not use health services when they needed them before the pandemic. The limitation in access to health services in Honduras and El Salvador countries is 24%, in contrast to the Andean countries, which average 32%. 

The main causes of lack of access are common to all countries: lack of money (21%), lack of health coverage (19%), lack of documentation (7%), lack of knowledge of services (5%), difficulties in getting around (2%), distance from health centres (1%). The rest of the percentage corresponds to other causes, such as difficulties in attending the medical centre, not having someone to go with them or not prioritising the need for care.  

More than a fifth (21%) of those who used health services have had to pay, which, given the severe financial condition that most older people in situations of human mobility are subject to, severely limits their ability to access the services they need.

###	Discrimination over being older and on the move 
 

The overall rate of elder abuse surveyed in the countries under study before the pandemic is 38%, with a marked difference between those with disabilities (48%) and those without (29%). During the pandemic, averages of abuse do not seem to be subject to significant fluctuations; however, only a quarter of people attend medical facilities following abuse and 23% report abuse, leaving a substantial percentage of people unprotected in this respect. 

```{r, layout="l-screen"}
include_graphics("images/SPA_WIDE_MACRO 2.png")
```

In Honduras and El Salvador, the percentage of elder abuse is 63%, with a significant difference between persons with disabilities (87%) compared to those without disabilities (40%). The gender difference is 11 points, with 65% for men compared to 57% for women. In the Andean region, mistreatment is lower, affecting a quarter of the population (26%), and there is a gender difference of 34% for women compared to 20% for men.

The most commonly occurring type of abuse against older persons with disabilities in the countries of the Andean region is eviction (8%), affecting more women than men in this situation, by three percentage points.  

Among the perpetrators of abuse, 11% were family members; 7% were government officials, including the security forces; 7% were friends or neighbours; and 74% were other people, for example, armed actors, gangs, people on the street, on public transport, or the owners of the homes which they rented or where they lived.

##	COVID-19 has impacted their livelihoods, metal health and physical conditions

 
Emotional illnesses and disorders, which were already at an advanced stage of requiring psychological treatment, especially in older people who are victims of internal displacement and deportation, have been intensified by the pandemic. 


```{r, layout="l-screen"}
include_graphics("images/SPA_WIDE_MACRO 1.png")
```


Isolation is one of the most important effects, as people cannot meet with friends and family as they normally would, and their recreation is also reduced. The pandemic has led to a decrease in the daily contact of older people in human mobility with their families, from 39% to 26%, which has an impact on feelings of isolation and loneliness, which, in turn, aggravates physical and mental health conditions.  
Overall, limitation in accessing health services to treat symptoms or illnesses other than those associated with the virus is increasing, reaching 43% in Honduras and El Salvador and 44% in the Andean region. The limitation is even greater for persons with disabilities, involving half of the sample (50%).  



## Conclusions 

  * 	Irregularity or lack of access to asylum facilities can lead to a series of risks and difficulties in the enjoyment of rights by older persons in human mobility. This was mainstreamed in the results that were analysed in terms of access to health, housing, work and security, among other rights.

  * 	The main difficulties for obtaining documentation are, on the one hand, the high degree of misinformation on administrative procedures required to remain in the countries legally and, on the other, the absence of a priority approach to provide documentation by the respective authorities.  
  * 	Older persons have a number of health problems that tend to receive little attention. Mental health is the second most prevalent condition after hypertension and is linked to human mobility in all countries. This is a condition that requires urgent attention.
 
  * 	The vast majority of the older people in human mobility surveyed live in a situation of great economic vulnerability, since very few or no pensions are received, and access to work is limited by the conditions of the labour markets, by the lack of documentation and by discrimination mainly due to age and mobility. All this leads to informality in situations of precariousness and labour exploitation, with long working hours and low incomes, as well as degrading and dangerous situations. Precarious conditions are exacerbated in rural areas, especially for groups of people who may face forced displacement. 

  * 	There is a sector of the older population that is not being adequately nourished, with more than a fifth not eating three meals a day, compounded by a decrease in meal consumption as a result of the pandemic. Older people's diets are not nutritionally balanced, and this needs to be addressed in order to provide guidance and resources to people to improve their diets, control overweight, and prevent tan increase of chronic diseases. 

  * 	The older population in situation of human mobility is subject to poor security in terms of the right to housing. There are cases of overcrowding in Honduras, Colombia, and Peru. Eviction is another serious risk for older people and is a form of mistreatment of this population group as well as their families. 

  * 	Psychological abuse is a problem that should be prioritised, as it is linked to insecurity and violence. In this sense, older people in human mobility are more vulnerable than the rest of the population. Women suffer higher percentages of psychological abuse in several cases, and it is necessary to consider gender differences in terms of the forms of mistreatment. People in transit may be at high risk due to the extreme vulnerability that crossing irregular border crossings sometimes entails.
